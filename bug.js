```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient feature. However, if you are using an older version of Tailwind or have not properly configured your postcss setup, the gradient might not render correctly.  You may see an unexpected color or no gradient at all. This issue could also manifest if there are conflicts in your CSS classes or if the `from` and `to` color values are not valid Tailwind colors.
