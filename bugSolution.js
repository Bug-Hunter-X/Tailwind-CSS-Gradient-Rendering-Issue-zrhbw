// Check your Tailwind CSS version and ensure it's up-to-date.
// Verify your PostCSS configuration.  Make sure you have the necessary plugins installed and configured.
// Check for conflicting CSS classes that might override the gradient styles.  Inspect your element in the browser's developer tools to see if other styles are interfering.
// Ensure your `from` and `to` colors are valid Tailwind CSS colors.  Use the Tailwind CSS color palette.
