# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug
This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients. The bug manifests as a failure to render gradients correctly, potentially due to version mismatches, incorrect PostCSS configuration, or conflicting CSS classes.

## Bug Description
The gradient defined using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility does not render as expected. Instead of a smooth color transition, the element may display a single color, an unexpected color, or no gradient at all. This can be tricky to debug because it may be related to your project setup rather than the CSS itself.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying your Tailwind setup, ensuring that your PostCSS configuration is up to date, and checking for any conflicts with other CSS classes.
